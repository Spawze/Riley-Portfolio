                <p>Hello! My name is Robert Riley Allred,(he/him) and I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I was given the same name
                    as my dad, Robert, so I go by my middle name, Riley. I was born in Utah. My favorite color is green
                    (if you couldn't already tell).
                    My interest in computers started when I was young, and took a lot of interest in coding around when
                    I was in highschool. After highschool I loosely taught myself some things, but I've learned most
                    during the UofU web development boot-camp.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include: art, gaming, watching video or movies, furry fandom, and hanging out with
                    friends. Currently I work at the Associated Food Stores warehouse in Ogden UT, building pallets of produce,
                    and deli products, to provide for local grocery stores.</p>
                    <p>I am proudly part of the LGBTQ+ community. The character above with sunglasses is my
                        online persona that I created, named Spawze. I usually use him as an avatar and username to represent myself online,
                        since I'd rather not use my real name if I don't have to.
                    </p>
